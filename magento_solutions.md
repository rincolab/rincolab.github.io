RincoLab is an expert in creating Magento-based e-commerce solutions. Our philosophy is very simple: __Quality First__.

Creating Magento-based e-commerce solutions is not a rocket-science task. You can easily find many service providers in the market. You can also get cheap quotes like building a Magento site for a few thousand dollars. But be careful when some service providers offer you a very cheap quote. This seems to be very attractive, but may lead you to undesired situation. Creating a site is very easy, but the hard part is how to maintain it. After the site goes live, you'll need your service provider to fix bugs and add new features for you. Some service providers may charge a very high fee for maintenance tasks. In that cases, you have no choice, because you have already been locked-in by them. Since the original cost of developing the site is very cheap, the service provider may just give a solution with more bugs and issues.

#### This is never the case with RincoLab.

### High-Profile Developers

RincoLab only hires experienced lead/senior software engineers, even they cost much more. Our developers have an average of 8 years experience in the industry. They can deliver high quality solutions quickly and reliably. Our solutions have less bugs than others.

### Warranty and Support

All our solutions have a warranty of six months after going live. During the warranty period, any bug fixes will be free. After the warranty, we'll continue to provide paid support for bug fixing and new features.
